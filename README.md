# PAI

A phone-first build of [pi-web](https://github.com/agegr/pi-web).

pi-web runs the [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) coding agent in a browser —
sessions, files, git, skills, model configuration — and all of that is upstream's. What it
did not have is a layout composed for a phone, and it carries a handful of defects that a
phone runs into first. That is what this build changes, and nothing else.

```sh
npx @perturbationai/pai
```

It serves on `127.0.0.1:30141`. Add it to your home screen and it runs standalone, with
lock-screen notifications when a session finishes.

```sh
npx @perturbationai/pai --help          # ports, hostname, the PI_WEB_* environment
```

The environment variables are upstream's and unchanged — `PI_WEB_PASSWORD`,
`PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `PI_WEB_HOSTNAME` — so anything already configured against pi-web
keeps working.

## What is different from pi-web

Every change is listed below. The complete diff is one link: **[v0.9.1 → this
build](../../compare/upstream...main)** — the first commit in this repository is upstream
v0.9.1 imported verbatim, so the comparison against it is exactly what PAI changes.

### Fixed

Upstream defects rather than preferences. Each was reproduced before it was patched, and
each is better sent upstream than carried here.

- **A new session did not survive being left.** The workspace's last-open memory was not
  cleared, so the next load restored the session that was open before it. Loading a bare
  `/` ended at `?session=<the previous one>`. It matters most on a phone, where a
  home-screen app is relaunched constantly.
- **The first tap on a session row only produced a hover state,** revealing rename and
  delete under the finger, so opening the session took a second tap.
- **Hover painted into the inline style stuck after a touch.** iOS fires `mouseenter` and
  often never `mouseleave`, so the tint stayed under the finger — including a blue flash
  on whichever control the session dialog opened beneath.
- **An expanded thinking block lost its collapse target,** leaving a 14×17 icon as the
  only way back. It is 26×26 now, and 38×38 where the pointer is coarse.
- **The model button omitted its provider,** although the dropdown already groups by
  provider and the same model id can exist under two of them.
- **A model that is no longer configured went on being named,** which reads as a working
  selection. It now says "Select model".
- **The keyboard's height was read once,** and WebKit reports a half-settled value on the
  resize event itself. Read again as it settles, and polled.
- **The home indicator's inset stayed reserved while the keyboard covered it.**
- **A device kept the first build it ever cached.** The service worker named its cache
  after the package version, which a patched build never moves. Each build gets its own.
- **`/apple-touch-icon.png` was a 404** — the path Safari falls back to when adding to the
  home screen, which is where a miss gets the generated letter tile instead of the mark.
- **A tap in the terminal does not raise the keyboard on iOS.** iOS raises it when a focus
  lands inside a user gesture, and xterm focuses its hidden textarea as soon as the
  connection opens, long before a thumb arrives. Reproduced against stock v0.9.1.
- **A terminal in an installed iOS web app never connects.** `connect()` returned on
  `navigator.onLine` in silence — no error, no retry. A home-screen web app reports itself
  offline while every other request on the page goes through.

### Changed

Most are confined to a phone by a width or a pointer query. Three are not, and are how
this build looks on a desktop as well: Send's ground, the process group's frame, and the
model list's group headers.

- **The composer is one card,** with its controls on a row above the text line and Stop
  coming out onto that row while a turn runs rather than staying inside a menu.
- **Send is the app's own mark on a phone,** and keeps that dark ground without the mark
  everywhere else, where upstream paints the stock accent.
- **Every control on that row is 44pt to a thumb** without being drawn at 44 — a
  transparent extender behind each one is what the browser hit-tests.
- **The top bar floats over the transcript,** at 44pt, with the session name centred and
  the context window drawn as a ring beside it. The session panel is a full dialog.
- **The drawer takes 70% of the screen** and gives the session list the room: the file
  explorer starts collapsed on a phone unless asked for.
- **An empty new session stays centred, and drops onto the keyboard when one opens.**
- **The model list is reachable by thumb,** hung off the button that opened it, its
  provider headings without upstream's upper case.
- **A turn's process details are one enclosed group,** the model named once at its header.
- **The turn line says "cache read" rather than "cache R",** and how long the turn took.
- **It is called PAI,** with its own mark and wordmark.

### Added

- **Swipe a session row left for rename and delete.**
- **Swipe in from the left edge to open the drawer** — installed app only, where that edge
  is not already the browser's back gesture.
- **Pull the transcript down to put the keyboard away.**
- **A notice when the server has been rebuilt under an open page,** with a reload. An
  installed web app resumes from memory rather than reloading.
- **A way back to the latest message.**
- **A way out of the exported history.**
